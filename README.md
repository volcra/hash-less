# \#Less

\#Less or Hash-Less is an implementation of the Less command line. It is written in Groovy and uses the core JavaScript [compiler](http://lesscss.org/) and [Mozilla Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino) as libraries to compile the Less style sheet into CSS.

Many of the compiler options available in NodeJS are being ported to the Groovy version.

\#Less can be integrated as a Command Line Tool, JAR dependency and Maven or Gradle Plugins.
